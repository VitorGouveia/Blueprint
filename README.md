# Intro
This project defines rules and guidelines to be followed by other projects.

# Design
Inside this repository lies a highly customizable CSS framework to be used in internal projects.

There are some pre-built presets to use with this framework.

Read about the framework and how it works below:

# Documentation
ğŸš§ Work in progress ğŸš§
In the `documentation` folder you can find templates to be used for documentating your project.

Each template serves a different purpose.

## Interactive Readme
ğŸš§ Work in progress ğŸš§

## Software
The software documentation category refers to the code part of the project. It showcases technology and inovation by the dev team.

## Product
The product documentation category refers to the product part of the project. It should show the problem vs solution, biggest "selling points" and the business perspective of building.

# Technologies
Inside the `tech` folder you can find templates to be used for the software.

Each tech stack serves a differente purpose.

The tech stacks are also divided in 3 (three) different complexity levels. The complexity levels are numbered from 0 onwards. The bigger the complexity level the more complex and far from the basic web technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript) it is.

> Always try the simple route. When simple is not enough, go up one stack. (disclaimer: if you have the correct sense of complexity of your application, then use the appropriate stack for it.)

## Finding out my project complexity level
